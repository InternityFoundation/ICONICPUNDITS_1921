## TEAM ID: 1921
## IDEA TITLE: Hassle Free Shopping in era of COVID-19
### Problem focussed
People who did not resort to stockpiling of items of daily use had to face major inconvenience in recent days as grocery stores in many localities remained closed despite being given exemption under the lockdown till next 20 days.
The city had witnessed panic buying before Janata Curfew. However, following assurance by the administration that the sale of essential items like grocery, vegetables, medicines, fuel and dairy products will continue, many refrained from buying things in bulk.
This is a difficult situation because we need to avoid public gathering. People are forced to make a beeline at stores because only a few shops of food items and medicines are open.
We are trying to find a solution to this problem.

### The solution, you are bringing in
We propose a solution to this problem. A mobile application can be built which can allow grocery store owners to register themselves with their address details. And only a single person from each house can register for the app ( this can be assured by consumer no. on electricity bill) . So whenever people want to buy something from the store they can make a request on the app. Considering the addresses of both ( person & store), an appointment will be scheduled for that person with a given time slot and date. Person can send a list of products he/she wishes to buy to the appointed shop. He/she can go and collect, pay at the time slot allocated to them. In this way, crowd can be managed by allocating people to different time slots and stores,and sending the product list directly to the shop owner via app, makes the shop owner to keep a list of products ready with the bill, and also makes the customer avoid spending much time at the shop. With the identity of every person, application makes sure that the same person does not request for products repeatedly.(At Least 3 days interval is needed between 2 orders)

### How the solution will impact people 
The overcrowding of shops(Grocery Stores,Pharmaceutical Stores,Super Markets) will stop by the use of this application.All the people who want to buy any product will use this application to avail the essential services.It will ensure undisturbed supply of the essential services assuring that all the social distancing measures are followed.It will assist the store owners in managing the crowd.
